/*
 * ReactiveX extensions implements observer pattern
 * components:
 * - observables: composable streams of events
 * - observers: those interested on observables events
 * - operators: manipulate observables
 * - schedulers: execute actions related to operators
 * The RxCpp Library:
 * - it's a header only, c++ implementation
 * - can convert from STL containers to observables
 * - supports either a chaining or a pipe interface
 */

// ToDo: install package manager to add RxCpp to the project, across multiple platforms
